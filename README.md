Leo Choi's private repo for COMP20

Lab 9 Questions:
1. This repository holds solutions to the assignments and labs for the class.
2. Assignment 2 (Maurader's Map) was my favorite assignment because it was an interesting introduction to Google's APIs and it was a cool mini-app that could have real functionality with a few tweaks.
3. I've grown a decent amount, I'm now fairly confident in my googling things and it's interesting to know all of the processes going on behind the web.
4. Most important thing: good programming practice is key! There is little accountability in web programming, unlike coding in C where a compiler will reject your code if something is wrong. Just working isn't enough; make sure to have alt text attributes on image tags, sanitize input, and don't use hidden form fields.
5. Front end development of web apps (relating to how a2 was most interesting)
