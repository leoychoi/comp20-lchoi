1. I was not able to retrieve real-time data using the MBTA API. Everything else has been implemented correctly. The MBTA has not enabled cross-origin request sharing and so does not allow requests from different origin servers. I simply print out the state of the request to the console since there is never a responseText returned.

2. no collaboration

3. 2 hours
